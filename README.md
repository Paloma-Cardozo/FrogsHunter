# 🐸 Frog Hunter – Memory Game

Frog Hunter is a browser-based memory game developed as part of the **Foundation Project at Hack Your Future**.

The game is inspired by the classic Memory Game and challenges players to find all matching pairs of cards by flipping them two at a time.
Our focus is on making the game work and building a smooth, intuitive, and enjoyable experience that encourages players to keep playing.

This project is developed incrementally, following a sprint-based approach, where functionality, structure, and complexity grow step by step.

## 🎮 About the Game

In Frog Hunter, players interact with a grid of cards showing frog-themed images.

- Cards start face down
- Players flip cards to reveal the images
- Only two cards can be revealed at the same time
- Matching cards remain revealed
- Non-matching cards flip back after a short delay
- The game ends once all matching pairs have been found
- The timer starts from when the player clicks their first card
- The counter shows how many times the player has revealed a card


The game logic and interactions are designed to be clear, responsive, and easy to understand.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Approach

This project is built using:

- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** for layout and animations
- **JavaScript** for game logic and DOM manipulation
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and collaboration

As part of the project milestones, the game evolves from a fully frontend-based implementation to a version that includes:

- Fetching card data from a backend API
- Storing card information in a database

These steps are introduced progressively as the project advances through the sprints.

## 📌 Project Context & Milestones

The project follows an iterative, sprint-based workflow:

- **Sprint 1:** Frontend fundamentals, card interactions, layout, and animations
- **Sprint 2:** Backend integration, API usage, and database-driven cards
- **Sprint 3:** Complete game logic and additional features to enhance gameplay

Each sprint builds on the previous one, taking the project from a simple interactive prototype to a fully playable memory game.
